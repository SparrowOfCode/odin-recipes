    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A light and fluffy pancake recipe the uses fresh buttermilk.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white suger</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1/3 cup butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, suger, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.
            Beat together buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter in a separate bowl.
            Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. You can flick
            water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready.
        </li>
        <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until
            it's just blended together. The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.
        </li>
        <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for
            each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes;
            flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
        </li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
